# The amount of packet size (in bytes) reserved as a safety margin when ViaVersion is installed.
#
# Due to protocol and NBT encoding differences between Minecraft versions, packets that are valid
# on the server side may grow in size after ViaVersion rewrites them for older clients.
# If the rewritten packet exceeds the client’s maximum allowed size, the client will disconnect
# with a DecoderException.
#
# This value reduces the effective maximum packet size on the server to leave headroom for
# unexpected size inflation caused by cross-version translation.
#
# NOTE:
# - This is NOT a vanilla limit. It is an additional safety buffer.
# - This cannot guarantee 100% prevention of client disconnects, but significantly reduces them.
# - The value is only applied when ViaVersion is present.
#
# Recommended values:
#   262144 (256 KB) – safe default for most servers
#   524288 (512 KB) – safer for NBT-heavy server or older client versions
#   0               – disable preserved size (vanilla behavior, not recommended with ViaVersion)
